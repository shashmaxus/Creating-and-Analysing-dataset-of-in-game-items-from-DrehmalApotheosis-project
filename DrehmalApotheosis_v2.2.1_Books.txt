It is one of four "Parables" in Drehua Temple, which each depict the serpent deity speaking with—and giving advice to—a Drehmari. This book sees an old Drehmari nun consult Drehmal when her town is running low on water, and being brought by the Realmbinder to an ancient rune. She is then instructed by the deity to ensure that her people's most important practices and teachings live on by using the written word to record their history, which in turn becomes the only reason that we have records of Drehmal's activity from the early second Avihm at all in Drehua Temple.

# Shorusharoh's Teachings

This book can be found on a lectern in [[Drehua Temple]], sacred place of [[Drehmal]]. It is one of four "Parables" in Drehua Temple, which each depict the serpent deity speaking with—and giving advice to—a Drehmari. In this book, a tired Drehmal comes across a scribe's apprentice who has been tasked with counting all the healthy trees in a massive orchard, and teaches them to approach their tasks with patience, as a job well done over a long time is the most rewarding. On this note, the serpent informs this Drehmari that they are content with their own work reshaping the realm for the time being, and are going to rest, before slithering away to the [[Primal Caverns]] to begin their indefinite slumber, making this likely the final recorded sighting of Drehmal.

# The Path - Part One: The Arc of Twilight

This book can be found in a chest in a tower in [[Sahd]]. The first of three books in "The Path," this text establishes the concept of the "Arc of Twilight."

Therefore, there must be an invisible portion of the cycle, an Arc of Twilight, and this applies to the concept of reincarnation as well.
